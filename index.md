## Have we done enough?

I guess as you get older, you start to think back and reflect on what you've done with your life. You question whether what you've done was "enough". If you can provide a home for your family, you're doing enough. If you're fostering children, you're doing enough. 

Before I get old, I want to make sure that what I've done, was **more** than enough.

I'm launching a startup, but its product is irrelevant. What's important is that I'll be donating 10% of all of our sales. Forever. If we're making 1M ARR, that's 100K a year going to charities. That's enough to make a difference. 

I pitched the idea to the co-founders of another startup I'm a part of. They're on board as well, and will be donating 10% of those profits.

Now, I'm challenging **you** to donate 10% of your startups profits to charitable organizations of your choice. Then, send me your startups link on Twitter, or make a PR to update the list below.

#### Who are you?
My name is Nick Haskins, and I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur living in the mountains of Boone, NC. You can find me babbling on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nphaskins).

#### Why did you make this?
I got the idea after posting an update on [my startups blog](https://sport-keeper.com/posts/7-january-update). In the post I talk about giving away 10% to a non-profit group. After talking to my co-founders and getting their excitement, I wanted to put this out there.

#### How does it work?
As of 3:26 P.M E.S.T on January 21st, 2019 it's an honor system with a list of links. For all I know we could be crazy for donating 10% of profits. But I'd like to do more (see below).

#### What's your plans?
As you can see this is just using a GH page for now to validate the idea. I'd like to get a real site up. Securing a hosting account is next. I'd also love to get some infrastructure in place to accept submissions. Some type of logo could be cool too. If you can help with any of this please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nphaskins).
