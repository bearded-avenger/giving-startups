      <h2 class="h3"> Have we done enough?</h2>

      <p>As you get older, you start to think back and reflect on what you've done with your life. You question whether what you've done was <em>enough</em>. Before I get old, I want to make sure that what I've done, was <strong>more</strong> than enough.</p>

      <p>I'm launching a startup, but its product is irrelevant. What's important is that I'll be donating 10% of all of our sales. Forever. If we're making 1M ARR, that's 100K a year going to charities. That's enough to make a difference. Now imagine that times 100. Or 1000 even.</p>

      <p>I pitched the idea to the co-founders of another startup I'm a part of. They're on board as well, and we'll be donating 10% of those profits.</p>

      <p>Now, I'm challenging <strong>you</strong> to donate 10% of your startups profits to charitable organizations of your choice. Send me your startups link on Twitter to be added to the list below. The link should at least mention plans to join Giving Startups.</p>

      <hr class="my-5" />

      <h4>Startups committed to giving 10%</h4>

      <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">Who are you?</p>
      <p class="mb-4">My name is Nick Haskins, and I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur living in the mountains of Boone, NC. You can find me babbling on <a href="https://twitter.com/nphaskins">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">Why did you make this?</p>
      <p class="mb-4">I got the idea after posting an update on <a href="https://sport-keeper.com/posts/7-january-update">my startups blog</a>. In the post I talk about giving away 10% to a non-profit group. After talking to my co-founders and getting their excitement, it inspired me to see who else might be interested.</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">How does it work?</p>
      <p class="mb-4">As of 3:26 P.M E.S.T on January 21st, 2019 it's an honor system with a list of links. For all I know we could be crazy for donating 10% of profits. But I'd like to do more (see below).</p>

      <p class="font-weight-bold mb-1">What's your plans?</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Right now this is just a free Github page. I'd like to get a real site up. Securing a hosting account is next. I'd also love to get some infrastructure in place to accept submissions, and possibly a way to verify giving. Some type of logo could be cool too. If you can help with any of this please reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/nphaskins">Twitter</a>.</p>
