I guess as you get older, you start to think back and reflect on what you've done with your life. You question whether what you've done was "enough". If you can provide a home for your family, you're doing enough. If you're fostering children, you're doing enough. 

Before I get old, I want to make sure that what I've done, was **more** than enough.

I'm launching a startup, but its product is irrelevant. What's important is that I'll be donating 10% of all of our sales. Forever. If we're making 1M ARR, that's 100K a year going to charities. That's enough to make a difference. 

I pitched the idea to the co-founders of another startup I'm a part of. They're on board as well, and will be donating 10% of those profits.

Now, I'm challenging **you** to donate 10% of your startups profits to charitable organizations of your choice.
